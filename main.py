#Create a Python script that assigns a grade to a student based on their exam score.
#Create a Python script that assigns a grade to a student based on their exam score.
# Ask the user to input a score. Assume the score is out of 100.
# Implement the logic to determine the grade based on the score:
# A score of 90 and above is an "A".
# A score of 80 to 89 is a "B".
# A score of 70 to 79 is a "C".
# A score of 60 to 69 is a "D".
# A score below 60 is an "F".
# Ensure the score entered is within the valid range (0-100). If not, print an error message.
